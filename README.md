# Data Structures and Algorithms notes

Here I will keep a notes of when to use which technique, method, algorithm, data structure for questions on Algorithms. This will be particularly usefulfor coding interviews.

## Arrays

Two pointer algorithm: This algorithm is particularly popular when using sorted arrays.

Binary Search: Similar to two-pointer, this algorithm can also be very effective when used in a sorted array.
